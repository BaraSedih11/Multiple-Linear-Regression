## Work steps
Programming Quiz: Multiple Linear Regression
In this quiz, you'll use the California housing dataset(opens in a new tab). The dataset consists of 8 features of 20,640 houses and the median home value in $100,000's. You'll fit a model on the 8 features to predict the value of the houses.

You'll need to complete each of the following steps:

1. Build a linear regression model

Create a regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression(opens in a new tab) and assign it to model.
Fit the model to the data.
2. Predict using the model

Predict the value of sample_house.
